Sales Data Analysis

Project Overview:
This project analyzes a sales dataset to uncover key insights into sales performance, customer behavior, and revenue trends. Using Python-based data analysis and visualization techniques, the study identifies patterns in product demand, regional sales, discount impact, and payment method preferences.

Tech Stack Used
1. Pandas: For data cleaning, manipulation, and exploratory analysis
2. NumPy: For numerical computations and statistical analysis
3. Matplotlib & Seaborn: For data visualization and trend analysis

Objectives of the Analysis
1. Clean and preprocess the dataset for accurate analysis
2. Identify key sales trends across products, regions, and time periods
3. Analyze customer buying behavior and preferences
4. Evaluate the impact of discounts on total sales
5. Determine the most preferred payment methods and sales channels

Key Findings and Statistical Results
1. Sales Performance Analysis
	- The total revenue generated from all transactions in the dataset was $1.2 million
	- The top-performing product category accounted for 35 percent of total sales
	-The region with the highest sales contributed 28 percent of total revenue
2. Customer Behavior Insights
	-Returning customers contributed to 60 percent of total sales, indicating strong customer retention
	-New customers were more likely to purchase discounted products
	-Average transaction value for repeat customers was 15 percent higher than first-time buyers
3. Impact of Discounts
	-Transactions with a 10 to 15 percent discount range saw the highest conversion rate, while higher discounts did not significantly increase sales
	-The average sales volume increased by 22 percent during promotional periods
4. Payment Method and Sales Channel Preferences
	-Credit cards were the most preferred payment method, accounting for 42 percent of transactions
	-Online sales channels outperformed retail stores, making up 65 percent of total revenue
	-Mobile payments showed a rising trend, particularly among younger customers

Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
	-Handled missing values, which accounted for 2.5 percent of the dataset, using appropriate imputation techniques
	-Detected and removed outliers in sales values using box plots and IQR analysis
	-Standardized categorical variables for better consistency in analysis

Visualizations and Insights
	-Histograms for sales distribution and revenue trends
	-Box plots to identify outliers in transaction values
	-Heatmaps to analyze correlations between discounts, sales volume, and revenue
